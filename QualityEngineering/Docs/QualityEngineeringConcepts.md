### ðŸ§  Modern Quality Engineering Concepts to Highlight

**1. Shift-Left Testing**
- Embedding testing early in the development lifecycle to catch defects sooner.
- Participating in refinement sessions and Three-Amigos workshops.

**2. Test Automation at Scale**
- Building reusable, scalable automation frameworks using Selenium WebDriver 4, Java, Cucumber BDD, TestNG, Jenkins, and Maven.
- Supporting CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.

**3. Continuous Testing**
- Integrating automated tests into CI/CD workflows for rapid feedback.
- Running smoke, regression, and performance tests on every build.

**4. Risk-Based Testing**
- Prioritizing test coverage based on business impact and defect likelihood.
- Reducing regression cycles while maintaining high defect detection rates.

**5. API Contract Testing**
- Validating backend services using Postman, Bruno, and custom assertions.
- Ensuring reliability and consistency across microservices.

**6. Cloud-Native Testing**
- Testing within cloud environments like AWS and Azure.
- Simulating real-world conditions using containerized test environments.

**7. GenAI-Driven Testing (Emerging)**
- Exploring GenAI tools to generate test cases, identify edge scenarios, or assist with test data creation.

**8. Data Migration Validation**
- Partnering with data engineers to validate large-scale migrations using SQL and automated checks.
- Ensuring data integrity and compliance post-migration.

**9. Observability & Monitoring Integration**
- Aligning QE with logging and monitoring tools to detect production issues early.
- Using dashboards to visualize test metrics and defect trends.

**10. Accessibility & Security Testing**
- Embedding accessibility checks into UI automation.
- Running security-focused test suites to identify vulnerabilities.
